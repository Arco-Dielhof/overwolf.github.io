## Game event status

It is highly recommended to communicate errors and warnings to app users. 

Check the current game event status [here](../status/all). Alternately, you can easily check that status from your app itself, [using our API](../topics/howto-check-events-status-from-app).

## `gep_internal`

#### *region* note

Data Example:

#### *agent* note

Not all agents have their game-name match their ID data, since this is an internal name, so take that into account.
Furthermore, if a character has an ability that gives him different points of view (f.ex Sova with his drone), the ID will change accordingly to the drone.

Data Example:

```json
{"info":{"me":{"agent":"Phoenix_PC_C"}},"feature":"me"}
```

#### *roster* note

<b>*Important:*</b> If players (or local player) in the match activate the option to hide their names from players outside their party, the output you will see will be the name of the agent (like `Jett` or in the case of the local player it will be `Me`) instead.
It is language dependant, so that is also important to take into account.

Data Example:

```json
{"info":{"match_info":{"roster_3":"{"name":"Sh4rgaas #EUNE","player_id":"2fb49e77-85c6-522c-a240-27c78a2f9a8f","character":"Pandemic","rank":0,"locked":false,"local":true,"teammate":true}"}},"feature":"match_info"}
