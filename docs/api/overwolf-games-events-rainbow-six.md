--------------- | -----------| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------- |

#### `roster_XX` notes

Each player joining the game will be reported in the following way:

Backslashes omitted for legibility.
```json
{
  "info": {
    "players":{
      "roster_0": "{
        "name": "WolfOnTop.top",
        "is_local": true,
        "team": 1,
        "operator": 0,
        "kills": 0,
        "headshots": 0,
        "deaths": 0,
        "score": 0,
        "defuser": 0,
        "health": 0
      }"
    }
  },
  "feature": "roster"}
```

As you can see, this object includes:

* name - player's name
* team - Blue/Orange/Spectator

As of version 159, you may detect the local player as a spectator when creating a custom match (Example: `{"info":{"player":{"team":"Spectator"}},"feature":"roster"}`).
* is_local - local player or not (Boolean)
* [operator](https://github.com/overwolf/community-gists/blob/master/siege_operator_ids.json) - The ID of the selected operator (available for team members only)
* kills - Total amount of kills made by the player (<b>Important</b>: Kill score is being reset between rounds).
* deaths - Total amount of deaths (<b>Important</b>: Death score is being reset between rounds).
* score - Player score in the current round (<b>Important</b>: Score is being reset between rounds).
* health - Current health of the player (available for team members only)

When one of the players leaves the match, the relevant “roster_ XX” object will be updated to:

`{"players":{"roster_3":null}}`

If a new player replaces a leaver, a new “roster_XX” object will be assigned to the new player who joined.
